# Zankuro's personal theme

This is my discord theme. It was a project for a friend but it ended up as a personal theme. This theme is used in my dotfiles.

The theme for highlight.js can be found on [here]()

## Requirements

- [Powercord](https://powercord.dev/)

## Installation

Go got to your Discord. Then Settings -> Themes -> Three vertical dots -> Open Themes Folder -> Shift right click -> Open power shell.

Then introduce this command `git clone https://github.com/ZanKur0/discord-theme.git`.

Important: **Don't make any folder**. Then restart discord and you will be able to use it.

## Problems

- Bad coded ( It was rushed ).
- Uncommented fixes ( I don't remember 90% of them ).

## Contribute

Fork it, and do a pull request. (That would be awesome).
